## 📘 Overview

This repository provides an **in-depth, postgraduate-level exploration of optimization algorithms** used in machine learning — from **classical gradient-based methods** to **state-of-the-art curvature-aware optimizers**.

Each notebook blends:
- 🎓 **Rigorous mathematical foundations**
- 📈 **Interactive visualizations**
- 🧩 **Geometric intuitions**
- 💡 **Comparative experiments**

All explanations are self-contained and progressively build intuition for the underlying geometry, convergence behavior, and practical trade-offs of each method.
